Often simply  called “the Realm,” this geographic region between the witch-ruled nation of Irrisen to the west and the demon-plagued Sarkoris Scar to the east lacks definable borders. The people of the Realm roam the broad span of tundra and mountains and consider the whole of the natural world their home. 
Though [[Mammoth Lord]] [[Following]]s are the most common  form of society in the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, other types of societies exist as well, such as the permanent mountain encampment called [[Hillcross]], where many followings go to trade or negotiate treaties.

Xiat's Note: This is the land where we are. It's a hostile land for a Lizardfolk, but I'm glad I found the [[Broken Tusk]] tribe to help me survive this.
