The great-grandson of [[Grandfather Eiwa|Eiwa’s]] late sister and heir apparent of Falcon House.  Though the web of friendships in the Broken Tusk following is complex, haughty and self-righteous Pakano is more likely to be your character’s rival or bully than a childhood chum.

*Xiat's Note: Not a nice kid. Maybe the only person in the tribe that made me feel unwelcome. Constantly boasts about his own skills but couldn't pour milk out of a boot if you wrote the instructions on the sole. My only solace is that Willow and Kaska also don't seem to be very fond of him.*
