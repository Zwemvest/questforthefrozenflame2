The [[Broken Tusk]]’s patron deity is Sister Cinder, goddess of fire and wisdom. Long ago, when the world was shrouded in ash after a great cataclysm, Sister Cinder bestowed a divine light upon  
the Broken Tusk’s ancestors. The light enabled her followers to cut through the veil of darkness and help restore the world’s natural order, as well as to discern right from wrong. In other parts of the world, Sister Cinder is known as Sarenrae.
