Each member of the [[Broken Tusk]] [[following]] belongs to one of four different houses. Each is led by a single high-ranking Tusk (who’s also typically a [[Mammoth Lord]], though not always). House members spend most of their time with one another, sharing duties, forming friend groups, and occupying the same communal sleeping tent.  

Each house is represented by a triad of animals that individually embody courage, cleverness, and resilience. Broken Tusks typically identify themselves with just one of the three animals represented in their house, and their personal effects often feature that animal. The four houses, their leaders, and the animals that embody each house are as follows.

• [[Falcon House]] (headed by [[Grandfather Eiwa|Eiwa]]), which includes hares and glyptodons.  
• [[Moose House]] (headed by [[Nakta the Healer|Nakta]]), which includes bears and ravens.  
• [[Musk Ox House]] (headed by [[Merthig the Firekeeper|Merthig]]), which includes saber-toothed tigers and bighorn sheep.  
• [[Otter House]] (headed by [[Argakoa the Songsinger|Argakoa]]), which includes wolves and auroch
