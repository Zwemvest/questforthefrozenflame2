**Full name: Banner of the Broken Tusk**

Though those who call themselves “Broken Tusks” can trace their lineage back thousands of years, the banner of the Broken Tusk itself —which symbolizes the values of its followers— is fairly new. 

Six generations ago, a terrible evil crawled from the earth and threatened the land. To stave off this evil, a few rebellious members of one following made a great sacrifice. The other members, feeling betrayed, took their banner with them, [[Ethgir and Syorn|forcing the rebels who remained to make a new name and identity for themselves]]. To symbolize their perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds, the rebels called themselves the Broken Tusk.

The [[Broken Tusk]]’s patron deity is Sister Cinder.

At the outset of our campaign, the Broken Tusk [[following]] numbers 74

The Broken Tusk is led by five [[Mammoth Lord]]s: [[Argakoa the Songsinger]], her dour but willful husband [[Letsua]], [[Merthig the Firekeeper]], [[Nakta the Healer]], and wise old [[Grandfather Eiwa]]. Of the five, Argakoa and Eiwa have filled their roles longest, followed by Merthig, Nakta, and Letsua.

At the outset of the Quest for the Frozen Flame Adventure Path, head scout [[Wipa]] has taken your party under her wing and is training you to become the next generation of great Broken Tusk scouts. Along with you, she is training [[Pakano]], the great-grandson of Eiwa’s late sister and heir apparent of [[Falcon House]].

*Xiat's Note: This is our tribe! Some of my friends have spent their entire lives with the tribe, like Kaska and Willow. I only joined fairly recently.*
